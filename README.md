## Description

This is a CMS styled blogging website where the user can create an account, post short blog posts, and add comments to the posts. 

This was a great project that really tied in all of our learning topics thus far, it was challenging due to time constraints but I really enjoyed this project. 

This app utilizes node.js, express.js, and sequelize.
